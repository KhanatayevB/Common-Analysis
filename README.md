Overall Description of the Project: 

More and more frequently summers in the western US have been characterized by wildfires with smoke billowing across multiple western states. There are many proposed causes for this: climate change, US Forestry policy, growing awareness, just to name a few. Regardless of the cause, the impact of wildland fires is widespread. There is a growing body of work pointing to the negative impacts of smoke on health, tourism, property, and other aspects of society.
The course project will require that you analyze wildfire impacts on a specific city in the US. The end goal is to be able to inform policy makers, city managers, city councils, or other civic institutions, to make an informed plan for how they could or whether they should make plans to mitigate future impacts from wildfires.
